# CS-350

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
This repo has two projects: one is to create a code to control LEDs on the MCU via ON/OFF inputs sent to the computer using UART. The second is the main project of the class, a thermometer; this project uses I2C sensors to read the ambient temperature, UART, and GPIO to control temperature settings. 

**What did you do particularly well?**
What I did particularly well is creating compartmental code that allows for easy editing as well as synthesizing the provided code and adding my own to solve the requirements given.

**Where could you improve?**
I could improve in understanding timers and how to implement them better.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
I added my knowledge of embedded C programming to my network of resources for future job searches.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
The skills from this project that will be particularly transferable is the new knowledge I got from working with state machines. I will use the knowledge I got from being able to apply my code to a physical board, which gave me a better understand how my code affects the real world.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
The project was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable through the use of comments as well as keeping each function as a separate, single goal oriented function. This allows myself and others to be able to understand and easily change one part of the project without affecting other parts.
